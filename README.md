# Build & Host your own Profile Card with WnCC


Your goal is to customize the provided HTML and CSS code to build a profile card that's uniquely yours. You'll add your own details, change the layout, play with colors, and maybe even add some cool interactive effects.

After you're done playing around, we'll host your webpage on IIT Bombay's servers! Watch as your creation goes live and share the link far and wide :)

### **Step 1: Get the Starter Code**

You have the code right here in this repository! We'll be copying this code over to an online editor called CodePen.

* First, open the `index.html` file on GitHub. In the top-right corner of the file view, click the **"Copy raw contents"** icon. This will copy all the HTML code. Switch over to the next step before coming back -->
* Next, do the same for the `style.css` file. Open it, click the **"Copy raw contents"** icon, and copy all the CSS code.

---

### **Step 2: Set Up Your Codepen**

* Go to [**codepen.io**](https://codepen.io/) and click **"Start Coding"**.
* You will see three boxes: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JS**.
* Feel free to toggle the view (top right) depending on your comfort.
* Paste your copied `index.html` code into the **HTML** box.
* Paste your copied `style.css` code into the **CSS** box.
* You can ignore the **JS** box for today.

You should now see a basic profile card appear in the live preview window! You're all set to start customizing.

### **Step 3: Customize and Style!**

This is where the magic happens. Your challenge is to modify the HTML and CSS to make this card your own. We've created two detailed cheatsheets to help you.

* **To add or change content** (like adding a list of skills or a new photo), refer to the:
    [`HTML_CHEATSHEET.md`](./HTML_CHEATSHEET.md)
* **To change the look and feel** (colors, fonts, shadows, hover effects), refer to the:
    [`CSS_CHEATSHEET.md`](./CSS_CHEATSHEET.md)


Don't be afraid to experiment! You can always come back and reuse the code from this repository.

### **Step 4: Go Live! Host Your Creation**

Once your card looks amazing, it's time to go live using IIT Bombay's official homepage hosting service.

#### Uploading to the IITB Server

1.  Open your browser and go to: [**bighome.iitb.ac.in**](https://bighome.iitb.ac.in)
2.  Log in using your **LDAP ID** and password.
3.  Once logged in, create a folder named **`public_html`** by clicking the "+ New" button.
4.  Click to enter the **`public_html`** folder.
5.  Now, add your files. Click the "+ New" button followed by **"New document"**. Name it `index.html` and copy-paste your HTML code from the CodePen editor. Do the same to create a `style.css` file as well.
6. If you used a custom image, don't forget to upload that too! (Keep the file names consistent)

### The Big Reveal!

This is the moment of truth. The URL for your live homepage is:

**`http://homepages.iitb.ac.in/~LDAPID`**

For example, if your LDAP ID is `24b3006`, your URL would be: `http://homepages.iitb.ac.in/~24b3006`

Open that URL in a new tab. You should see your creation live. Share it with your friends!
